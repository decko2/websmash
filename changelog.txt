- New updating GUI [MANUAL]
- New success update alert [MANUAL]
- Security improvements
- Updated a EULA
+ User privacy is now more protected
+ Added a Tovar Reset (can be found in a update folder)

! Every new feature, where is [MANUAL] - you need to update software manually to get this software,
so you need to contact a developer with a software download request !

NOTE:

* I'll try to add a more software languages.
* I'm not sure, but i think that in a new update
will be updated GUI, but i'm not sure.
* I'll try to remove requirement of manual downloading - all update
files (in UPDATE folder) will be updated automatically too.
