If updater asked you for the administrator access, and you selected YES, then you get a successful message about successful startup entries installing, your software updater completed all actions.

If you get only success message, you're OK because of disabled UAC prompt.

If you selected NO on administrator uac prompt, and/or you get unsuccessful message, select in 'Update' menu option 'Update immediately' and select 'YES' on UAC prompt.

Thanks,
