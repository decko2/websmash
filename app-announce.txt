Hi,

many of people are scared of malwares, etc.. 
this announcement is about new screen locker!

Don't worry, the new screen locker will require administrator privileges for you
because of automatical disabling task manager, regedit and etc..

Publisher is unknown, that's the reason of this announcement.
The screen locker is safe, made by us, not a malware, so it's safe
to allow administrator ...

Keep in mind.. if anyone send you a copy of screen locker, DON'T OPEN IT!
Open only executables from verified publisher, or from us.

Thank you for reading! :)
#staysafe

Have a nice day,
Smasher Team
